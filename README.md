# Trackr ASP.NET Core Backend

## Description

This project is an alternative server for [Trackr](https://github.com/paynerg2/application-tracker). It attempts to follow as many ASP.Net Core best practices as seemed practical for a project of this size while recreating the original backend as closely as possible.

## Motivation

Quickly get back up to speed with current C# / ASP.NET Core development practices by applying it to a project with specifications that already existed, and would not change.

Some excellent resources for anyone else interested in quickly get back into .NET development:

## Next Steps

-   Implement Google Login functionality while also grabbing the payload information to create a user with Identity if one doesn't already exist.
-   Add profile image upload to Cloudinary, or some other viable cloud host.
